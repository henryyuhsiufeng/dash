# dash
An anonymous chat app built with node.js, socket.io, express, and react.js

## The Goal
My goal with this project is to learn how to use feather.js and socket.io and reinforce my skills in react.js while also implementing a chat app.

## Getting Started
Change in package.json the start script 
```
"test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
```

to
```
"start": "node app"
```

### Socket.io
Used for real time data transferring.  

- Command Line with integration with express and socketio. Moment.js is a package that will aid with time in the application: 
```
npm i @feathersjs/feathers @feathersjs/express @feathersjs/socketio moment
```

## 


### Server (directory)
 
## Client (directory)
```
npm install --save react-router socket.io-client react-scroll-to-bottom react-emoji query-string
```

### React.js
```
npm init -y

npm install --save nodemon socket.io express
```
